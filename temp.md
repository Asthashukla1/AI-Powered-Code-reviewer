The function you provided `function sum(){return a+b;}` has a small issue: it tries to use variables `a` and `b` that
are not defined within its scope or passed to it as arguments.

**Here's the corrected and most common way to write a `sum` function in JavaScript that takes two numbers as input:**

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`function sum(a, b)`:**
* We define a function named `sum`.
* `a` and `b` inside the parentheses are **parameters**. These are placeholders for the values that you will pass into
the function when you call it.

2. **`return a + b;`:**
* Inside the function, `a` and `b` now refer to the values that were passed in.
* The `+` operator adds these two values together.
* The `return` statement sends the result of `a + b` back as the output of the function.

**How to use it:**

```javascript
let result1 = sum(5, 3); // Calls the function with 5 for 'a' and 3 for 'b'
console.log(result1); // Output: 8

let result2 = sum(10, -2); // Another example
console.log(result2); // Output: 8

let result3 = sum(0.5, 1.2);
console.log(result3); // Output: 1.7
```

**What was wrong with your original version `function sum(){return a+b;}`?**

If `a` and `b` were not globally defined somewhere else in your code (which is generally bad practice), calling `sum()`
would result in a `ReferenceError` because `a` and `b` would be undefined.

```javascript
// If 'a' and 'b' are NOT defined globally:
function sumOriginal() {
return a + b;
}
// sumOriginal(); // This would throw a ReferenceError: a is not defined
```
